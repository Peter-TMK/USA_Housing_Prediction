### It's observed that the minimum and maximum values for USA house prices in the dataset are 15,938.66  and 2,469,066 Dollars respectively

### Checking the maximum number of years a house in this dataset has been in existence, we get Nine and half years.

## Using the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), there's a medial correlational influence by 'Average Area Income' on 'Price', having a value of 0.64

### The 'Average Area Number of Rooms' and 'Average Area Number of Bedrooms' have lower influences on the 'Price'
### While the 'Average Area House Age' have a fair contributing factor to the 'price'
